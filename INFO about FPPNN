FPPNN is short for Friction Point Prediction Neural Network

How do we humans go and pick up an object, we just go ahead and pick it up
but is that all happening,ofcourse not,we humans predict a point on the objects body where the application of force or pressure by our fingers will
provide us maximum grip and these are called friction points,
and how do we actually find those points..... we analyze its curvature,the type of material its made that is its coefficent of friction

so based on this observations by me, I created The FPPNN
